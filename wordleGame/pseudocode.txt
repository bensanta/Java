Frontend

        *****
    - (Optional) Make a place for user inpur on the GUI
    - (Optional) Create a clickable OK Button
        - if mouseX and mouseY is clicked between the top left and bottom right corner
            - then, the button was pressed.
    - Use the terminal command line for user input


Backend
- Generate a random word from the wordlist, and store it in a variable
- For loop 6 times:
    - Take user input using a scanner
        - if userWord == randomWord:
            - Check if the user input is 5 letters, not more, not less:
                - if not, then stop the program, and throw an error msg
                - if it is, Check if the word the user entered, is in the world list
                    - if not, then don't let the user guess go through, and throw an error
                    - if the user entered word is 5 letters, and in the word list, place
                    each letter, in the corresponding location in the grid
            - (Front and Backend) Create a method which changes the colours of the grid, depending on
            if the letter(s) match the one that was randomly generated
            - Then, for loop through the word 5 times (checking each letter):
                - if the letter is in the word, turn the box yellow
                - else if the letter is in the correct position, turn the box green
                - else, turn it gray
            - Then, ask for another user input
    - else, break (no need to loop or check any of the new words)
